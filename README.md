This repository holds analysis code for 'Mapping neurodevelopmental diversity in executive function' (Mareva et al., 2024). There are two R files used for the behavioural and neuroimaging analyses: soms (self-organising maps and k-means clustering of executive function measures) and plsda (neuroimaging analyses using partial least squares discriminant analyses for the connectome data). 

The data was acquired using the procedures described in the study protocol (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-018-1385-3). The CALM dataset is freely available to the research community through a managed open-access portal, subject to terms and conditions ensuring ethical and responsible data use. For details, please visit https://portal.ide-cam.org.uk/overview/1158. The neuroimaging data was pre-processed using qsiprep following the procedures described in the manuscript. For details, please visit https://qsiprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
